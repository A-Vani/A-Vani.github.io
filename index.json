Recent advancements with instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have shed light on high-redshift galaxies‚Äîthose that existed billions of years ago. However, most theoretical models, such as the Munich semi-analytical model, also known as L-GALAXIES, are tuned to match galaxies in the local universe and have not been rigorously tested against these early galaxies. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics and the University of Bonn comprehensively evaluated the L-GALAXIES model using the latest observations and found that while the model aligns well with the properties of local galaxies, it struggles with key aspects of high-redshift galaxies. Particularly, the study highlights critical issues with the model‚Äôs predictions of quenched galaxies, those that have ceased star formation, including their number density, size and compactness in the early universe, suggesting a need to revise the implementation of processes driving star formation quenching, including supermassive black hole feedback and galaxy mergers.

This study is the first to compare predictions of L-Galaxies with high-redshift observations well outside the original calibration regime, utilising multiband data from surveys such as SDSS, CANDELS, COSMOS, HST, JWST, and ALMA. We assess the models‚Äô ability to reproduce various time-dependent galaxy scaling relations for star-forming and quenched galaxies. Key focus areas include global galaxy properties such as stellar mass functions, cosmic star formation rate density, and the evolution of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Additionally, we examine resolved morphological properties such as the galaxy mass-size relation, alongside core (ùëÖ \u003c 1 kpc) and effective (ùëÖ \u003c ùëÖe) stellar-mass surface densities as a function of stellar mass. This analysis reveals that the L-Galaxies models are in qualitatively good agreement with observed global scaling relations up to ùëß ‚âÉ 10. However, significant discrepancies exist at both low and high redshifts in accurately reproducing the number density, size, and surface density evolution of quenched galaxies. These issues are most pronounced for massive central galaxies, where the simulations underpredict the abundance of quenched systems at ùëß ‚â• 1.5, reaching a discrepancy of a factor of 60 by ùëß ‚âà 3, with sizes several times larger than observed. Therefore, we propose that the physical prescriptions governing galaxy quenching, such as AGN feedback and processes related to merging, require improvement to be more consistent with observational data.

A volume-complete sample of white dwarfs is essential for statistical studies of the white dwarf population. The sample of nearby white dwarfs is the only one that allows the faint end of the luminosity function to be probed and thus is the only one that covers the entire range of white dwarf ages. However, due to their intrinsic faintness, even nearby white dwarfs are difficult to identify. Aims. Our work focuses on improving the completeness and purity of the white dwarf census within 50 pc of the Sun. To accomplish this, we used Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) to identify and characterise new and previously overlooked white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. We also identify objects with spurious astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3 but claimed as high-confidence white dwarfs in the Gaia Catalogue of White Dwarfs (GCWD21) by Gentile Fusillo et al. (2021). Methods. Based on the astrometry and photometry in Gaia DR3, we identified new nearby white dwarfs and validated those that had been missed from recent white dwarf catalogues despite being previously documented. To ensure the reliability of their astrometric solutions, we used a cut on just two parameters from Gaia DR3: the amplitude of the image parameter determination goodness-of-fit and the parallax-over-error ratio. In addition, we imposed photometric signal-to-noise requirements to ensure the reliable identification of white dwarfs when using the colour-magnitude diagram. Results. We have identified nine previously unreported white dwarfs within the local population of 50 pc, and validated 21 previously reported white dwarfs missing from the GCWD21 and other recent volume-limited white dwarf samples. A few of these objects belong to the rare class of ultra-cool white dwarfs. Four white dwarfs in our sample have an effective temperature of Teff ‚â§ 4000 K within the 1œÉ interval, and two of them have an absolute magnitude of MG \u003e 16.0 mag. The identified white dwarfs are predominantly located in crowded fields, such as near the Galactic plane or in the foreground of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also find that 19 of these white dwarfs have common proper motion companions with angular separations ranging from 1.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ to 7.1‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ and brightness differences between the components of up to 9.8 magnitudes. One of these systems is a triple system consisting of a white dwarf and two K dwarfs, while another is a double white dwarf system. The identified white dwarfs represent a 1.3% improvement in the completeness of the 50 pc sample, resulting in a new total of 2265 known white dwarfs located within 50 pc of the Sun. We have identified 103 contaminants among the 2338 high-confidence white dwarfs in the 50 pc subsample of the GCWD21 and have found that their astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3 are spurious, improving the purity by 4.4%.

Aims- The aim of the CNS5 is to provide the most complete sample of objects in the solar neighbourhood. For all known stars and brown dwarfs in the 25 pc sphere around the Sun, basic astrometric and photometric parameters are given. Furthermore, we provide the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) and various luminosity functions of the stellar content in the solar neighbourhood, and characterise the completeness of the CNS5 catalogue. Methods- We compiled a sample of stars and brown dwarfs that are most likely located within 25 pc of the Sun, taking space-based parallaxes from Gaia EDR3 and HIPPARCOS as well as ground-based parallaxes from Best et al. (2021, AJ, 161, 42), Kirkpatrick et al. (2021, ApJS, 253, 7), and from the CNS4 into account. We developed a set of selection criteria to clean the sample from spurious sources. Furthermore, we show that effects of blending in the Gaia photometry, which mainly affect the faint and red sources in Gaia, can be mitigated to reliably place those objects in a CMD. We also assessed the completeness of the CNS5 using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and derive observational optical and mid-infrared (MIR) luminosity functions for the main-sequence stars and white dwarfs (WDs) in the solar neighbourhood. Results- The CNS5 contains 5931 objects, including 5230 stars (4946 main-sequence stars, 20 red giants and 264 white dwarfs) and 701 brown dwarfs. We find that the CNS5 catalogue is statistically complete down to 19.7 mag in the G-band and 11.8 mag in W1-band absolute magnitudes, corresponding to a spectral type of L8. The stellar number density in the solar neighbourhood is (7.99 ¬± 0.11) √ó 10-2 stars pc-3, and about 72% of stars in the solar neighbourhood are M dwarfs. Furthermore, we show that the WD sample in CNS5 is statistically complete within 25 pc. The derived number density of WDs is (4.03 ¬± 0.25) √ó 10‚àí3 stars pc-3. The ratio between stars and brown dwarfs within 15 pc is 4.6 ¬± 0.4, whereas within 25 pc it is 7.5 ¬± 0.3. Thus, we estimate that about one third of brown dwarfs are still missing within 25 pc, particularly those with spectral types later than L8 and distances close to the 25 pc limit.

Initially, we test the calibrated JJ model and found minor inconsistencies (about 0.2 % and 2.2 % in 25 pc and 60 pc volume) in total star counts based on Gaia EDR3 data, implying excellent data-to-model consistency. Subsequently, this work incorporated WD synthesis into the model using BaSTI DA and DB (carbon-oxygen core) isochrones and an initial-final mass relation. This work also modeled stellar lifetimes and derived an analytical fit for the DA/DB ratio as a function of effective temperature. Additionally, we established a volume-complete sample of Gaia DR3 WDs within 60 pc and found that the updated JJ model over-predicts WDs by 52%, potentially attributed to assumptions regarding the initial mass function (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR). Exploring this dependency on the IMF, we derived a test IMF; however, a thorough MCMC-based model calibration is warranted. This extended JJ model serves as a valuable tool for studying Milky Way evolution, IMF, SFR, and WD kinematics.\n","date":1664409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710088405,"objectID":"70072dd052530b581d2dc4311d49c5cf","permalink":"https://a-vani.github.io/project/jjmodel/","publishdate":"2022-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/jjmodel/","section":"project","summary":"Master's thesis","tags":["Major-Projects","Thesis"],"title":"Properties of stellar populations and white dwarfs in a semi-analytic Milky Way disk model based on Gaia DR3","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1660557600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679825406,"objectID":"24d280b1bcc1b821c15910ab76e402e0","permalink":"https://a-vani.github.io/talk/properties-of-white-dwarfs-in-the-jj-model-based-on-gaia-edr3/","publishdate":"2023-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/properties-of-white-dwarfs-in-the-jj-model-based-on-gaia-edr3/","section":"event","summary":"In this talk, I present the properties of white dwarfs synthesised in a semi-analytical Milky Way model and its comparison to the the Gaia data","tags":[],"title":"Properties of White Dwarfs in the JJ model based on Gaia (E)DR3","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This project involved the investigation of two binary systems with the potential to form a quadruple system.
