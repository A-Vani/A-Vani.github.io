Aims- The aim of the CNS5 is to provide the most complete sample of objects in the solar neighbourhood. For all known stars and brown dwarfs in the 25 pc sphere around the Sun, basic astrometric and photometric parameters are given. Furthermore, we provide the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) and various luminosity functions of the stellar content in the solar neighbourhood, and characterise the completeness of the CNS5 catalogue. Methods- We compiled a sample of stars and brown dwarfs that are most likely located within 25 pc of the Sun, taking space-based parallaxes from Gaia EDR3 and HIPPARCOS as well as ground-based parallaxes from Best et al. (2021, AJ, 161, 42), Kirkpatrick et al. (2021, ApJS, 253, 7), and from the CNS4 into account. We developed a set of selection criteria to clean the sample from spurious sources. Furthermore, we show that effects of blending in the Gaia photometry, which mainly affect the faint and red sources in Gaia, can be mitigated to reliably place those objects in a CMD. We also assessed the completeness of the CNS5 using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and derive observational optical and mid-infrared (MIR) luminosity functions for the main-sequence stars and white dwarfs (WDs) in the solar neighbourhood. Results- The CNS5 contains 5931 objects, including 5230 stars (4946 main-sequence stars, 20 red giants and 264 white dwarfs) and 701 brown dwarfs. We find that the CNS5 catalogue is statistically complete down to 19.7 mag in the G-band and 11.8 mag in W1-band absolute magnitudes, corresponding to a spectral type of L8. The stellar number density in the solar neighbourhood is (7.99 ± 0.11) × 10-2 stars pc-3, and about 72% of stars in the solar neighbourhood are M dwarfs. Furthermore, we show that the WD sample in CNS5 is statistically complete within 25 pc. The derived number density of WDs is (4.03 ± 0.25) × 10−3 stars pc-3. The ratio between stars and brown dwarfs within 15 pc is 4.6 ± 0.4, whereas within 25 pc it is 7.5 ± 0.3. Thus, we estimate that about one third of brown dwarfs are still missing within 25 pc, particularly those with spectral types later than L8 and distances close to the 25 pc limit.

First, we test the JJ model’s calibration and find the inconsistency in the total star counts to be about 0.2 % and 2.2 % in 25 pc and 60 pc volume based on Gaia EDR3, respectively, implying an excellent data-to model consistency. We then enable the model to synthesise WDs using BaSTI DA and DB (carbon-oxygen core) WD isochrones and an initial-final mass relation. We also model the stellar lifetimes and produce an analytical fit to model the DA/DB ratio as a function of Teff. Finally, we also derive a volume complete Gaia DR3 WD sample in 60 pc and find that the JJ model over-predicts WDs by 52 %. This inconsistency can be linked to the assumed properties of the initial mass function (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR). Thus, the text briefly explores the model’s dependence on the IMF. A test IMF is derived; however, a thorough MCMC-based model calibration is required. This extended JJ model constitutes an excellent tool for deriving MW evolution relations such as the IMF and SFR and studying the kinematics of WDs.\n","date":1664409600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679843729,"objectID":"70072dd052530b581d2dc4311d49c5cf","permalink":"https://a-vani.github.io/project/jjmodel/","publishdate":"2022-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/jjmodel/","section":"project","summary":"Master's thesis","tags":["Major-Projects","Thesis"],"title":"Properties of stellar populations and white dwarfs in a semi-analytic Milky Way disk model based on Gaia DR3","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1660557600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679825406,"objectID":"24d280b1bcc1b821c15910ab76e402e0","permalink":"https://a-vani.github.io/talk/properties-of-white-dwarfs-in-the-jj-model-based-on-gaia-edr3/","publishdate":"2023-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/properties-of-white-dwarfs-in-the-jj-model-based-on-gaia-edr3/","section":"event","summary":"In this talk, I present the properties of white dwarfs synthesised in a semi-analytical Milky Way model and its comparison to the the Gaia data","tags":[],"title":"Properties of White Dwarfs in the JJ model based on Gaia (E)DR3","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" We found two binary systems which have the potential to be a quadruple system.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
