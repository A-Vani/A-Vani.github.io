      <title>The Fifth Catalogue of Nearby Stars</title>

The aim of this work was to construct and explore a catalogue of all stars withins 25pc around the Sun. I primarily did an early analysis of the completeness limit and the luminosity function and later explored the local stellar density variations and the properties of the stellar content of the catalogue. This work was later published in A&amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Properties of stellar populations and white dwarfs in a semi-analytic Milky Way disk model based on Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://a-vani.github.io/project/jjmodel/</link>

This work presents the extension to the white dwarfs (WD) of the semi-analytic chemo-dynamic model of the Milky Way disc, first presented by Just and Jahreiß (2010), called the JJ model. First, we test the JJ model’s calibration and find the inconsistency in the total star counts to be about 0.2 % and 2.2 % in 25 pc and 60 pc volume based on Gaia EDR3, respectively, implying an excellent data-to model consistency. We then enable the model to synthesise WDs using BaSTI DA and DB (carbon-oxygen core) WD isochrones and an initial-final mass relation. We also model the stellar lifetimes and produce an analytical fit to model the DA/DB ratio as a function of Teff. Finally, we also derive a volume complete Gaia DR3 WD sample in 60 pc and find that the JJ model over-predicts WDs by 52 %. This inconsistency can be linked to the assumed properties of the initial mass function (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR). Thus, the text briefly explores the model’s dependence on the IMF. A test IMF is derived; however, a thorough MCMC-based model calibration is required.
This extended JJ model constitutes an excellent tool for deriving MW evolution relations such as the IMF and SFR and studying the kinematics of WDs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spectral and timing study of LMXB system 4U 1702-429 using Astrosats X-ray data</title>
      <link>https://a-vani.github.io/project/1702/</link>

      <description>&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
This work aims at the spectral and timing study of a thermonuclear (Type-I) X-ray burst from 4U 1702-429, a low mass X-ray binary system. It uses data from ASTROSAT’s LAPXC and SXT instruments.

      <title>CPT synthesis of layered BiOI nanodiscs and its photocatalytic applications</title>
      <link>https://a-vani.github.io/project/cpt/</link>

      <description>&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Bismuth Oxyiodide (BiOI) is a photocatalytic material which shows remarkable electrical and optical properties, and can used to decompose pollutants in aquaous systems. In this work, we synthese BiOI nandics using the co-precipitative method and confirm the formation of the nano structures using  X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy methods. Upon the confirmation of the material, we also test its photocatalytic properties.
This work was lead by S. Patil which cumlminated into his bachelor thesis.

      <title>Photometric Calibration of UVIT</title>
      <link>https://a-vani.github.io/project/uvit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Photometric calibrations are important part of observations aimed at deriving photometric magnitudes of objects. In order to get useful calibrations, it is required to make various corrections for instrumental effects, such as. saturation and spatial variation of sensitivity. This work discusses the procedures to find best estimates of the photon counts per second (C/S) in the filters of UVIT (Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard ASTROSAT) for the calibration source HZ4 (a white dwarf) and an open cluster NGC188 at high declination. In particular it is checked that the procedures for flat field correction are effective in minimizing spatial variation to which leads to improved photometry.&lt;/p&gt;
